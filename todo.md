# TODO

- [ ] Refactor `variables` to be `<String, &Expression>`

## Current

- [ ] WHILE command

Need to add `TRUE` as a value/variable since `3_05` uses TRUE/FALSE expressions.

When do we need to check for a boolean value?

- A variable could have a boolean value.
- A value could just be a boolean too.

## Backlog

- [ ] Make tests
